Description:

This Python script generates an RSS feed and an OPML file for a given search query on a Searx instance. The RSS feed includes search results within a 4-hour timeframe, and the OPML file can be used to easily import the RSS feed into feed reader applications like Fluent Reader.

Features:

    Generates an RSS feed for search results within 4 hours of the current time.
    Creates an OPML file to facilitate importing the RSS feed into feed reader applications.
    Schedules the RSS feed generation to run automatically every 4 hours.
    Uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and the FeedGenerator library for feed generation.

Usage:

    Update the script with your desired search query and Searx instance URL.
    Run the script to generate both searx_rss_feed.xml and searx_opml_feed.xml files.
    Start a local HTTP server (e.g., by running python -m http.server 8000) to serve the generated files.
    Import the OPML file into your preferred feed reader application.

Dependencies:

    requests
    BeautifulSoup4
    feedgen
    python-dateutil
    schedule

Note: Please ensure that your feed reader can access the RSS feed URL specified in the OPML file. The script is set up to use a local URL, which means the feed will only be accessible on your local machine while the server is running. If you want to access the feed from another device, you may need to replace localhost with your local IP address or hostname.
